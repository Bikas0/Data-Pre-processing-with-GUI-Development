# Data Pre-processing with GUI Development
This project focuses on simplifying the data pre-processing phase by providing an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to interact with. Data pre-processing is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning pipeline, often requiring multiple transformations and manipulations to prepare raw data for further analysis.

<h1>Features<\h1>
User-Friendly Interface: The GUI offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the pre-processing tools.<br>
Multiple Pre-processing Options: Includes a variety of pre-processing techniques such as data cleaning, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and more.<br>
Customizable Workflow: Users can customize the pre-processing workflow based on their specific requirements, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.<br>
Export Functionality: Allows users to export the pre-processed data in various formats for further analysis or modeling.<br>
